# PogBot
Discord bot that keeps tracks of certain messages and who sent the most recent one

## Additional Notes
To get this bot working locally, you will have to create a config.json file that contains your bot token. No config file will be present here to maintian security of keys

## Purpose
This idea started off as a meme with my friends but it also allowed me to experiment with discord bots and NodeJS. This side project is intended to help strengthen
my understanding of these two concepts in my free time.

## Work In Progress
* Keep count of each type of server emoji sent in chat, in this case a pogChamp emote
* Display who sent the last matching emoji in the chat
* Clean up code 

## Future development
* Dynamically create a list of emojis to track using that Guild's list
* Data integrity if the bot is ever restarted or shuts down
